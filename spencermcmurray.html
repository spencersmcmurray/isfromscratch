        I love being with people! My friends and family take up most of my time and being from the South, we always look out for each other. My hometown of Abingdon, Virginia has 10,000 people in the middle of the Appalachian mountains and everyone knows everyone! Sports were crucial to my family since it gave my mom a break from taking care of 8 kids in our home and I loved being with friends and competing. The relationships I made with teammates are some of the longest friendships I have had, even after moving halfway accross the country.

        My hometown is Abingdon Virginia. It is a small town in the Appalachian Mountains in Southwest Virginia. I moved away when I was 15 but my family returned a few years later and I couldn't be more grateful. The relationships I made in my small town have followed me wherever I go and even though I may not end up living there with my own family, I have intentions to give back to the place that raised me and still gives me the motivation to keep on going, no matter where I am. I put a picture below so you can see what you're missing out on.

    My home county has severe poverty and one of the ways I want to give back is by investing in the community and helping kids get a better education and stay in school. Kids often drop out of school due to the fact that they have to work to support their families. Often times, this leads to high crime, high drug trafficking, and one of the highest opioid death rates in the entire United States. The Tableau diagram below shows US counties and one of the darkest visible areas is Southwest Virginia and Eastern Kentucky.
